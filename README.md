## 📖 Project Overview

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect malaria-infected red blood cells from images. The model is built and trained using **TensorFlow/Keras**, saved efficiently, and deployed using **Streamlit** for interactive diagnosis.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 📷 Image classification to detect malaria-infected cells
- 🧠 CNN model trained on labeled dataset
- 💾 Model saved in `.h5` format for light deployment
- 🌐 Streamlit app for real-time predictions
- ✅ TensorFlow used only for training — **not required in deployment**
